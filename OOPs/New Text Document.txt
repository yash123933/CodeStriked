joins :
cross, natural, using cluse, full outer joins, arbitrary join condition for outer join
use the using clause to match only one column when more then one column matches.
the join condition for the natural join we use on.
equi join is the one where equal to sign is used within the attributes.

 SubQueires
-----DML
use Parantheses/order by is not needed/use single-row operdator with single same with multiple.
single row/Multi row subqueires
**check having
multiple row queries:
in, any, all(check it later)

when you delete you can rollback bt you cannot rollback in truncate(try it)

we are allowed  to insert and delete the record from in dual as sysuser

primary key never gets alter because its a unique contraint.

rownum to represent row

----DDL
objects: table view(simple, complex) sequence index synonym
indexes are mainted by binary tree....primary key is built in index.
synonym is alternate name to objects.

Contraints:
not null, unque, primary key, foreign key, check
we can enable disable the constraints.
we can find constraints in data dictionary.
column level/table level constraints.
Null values in allowed in foregin key constraints.
foreign key contraints: foreign key, references, on delete cascade, on set null.
try operation on views
check option constarints is used in view to check for constarints when inserting in views
nextval returns next available sequence.
currval returns current sequence value.
applying sequences to table (to try)
when to create:when wide range, large number of null values, in a where clause or a join
